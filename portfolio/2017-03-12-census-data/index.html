If you’ve had the pleasure of stumbling around the U.S. Census website and awkwardly trying to transcribe and tabulate things in Excel you will quickly appreciate how very much better the R based approach is. Plus you can make pretty <em>and</em> interactive maps! :O</p>

<h2>Getting census data</h2>
<p>About 95% of the steps came from the <a href="http://zevross.com/blog/2015/10/14/manipulating-and-mapping-us-census-data-in-r-using-the-acs-tigris-and-leaflet-packages-3/#census-data-the-easyer-way">lovely tutorial</a> mentioned above, but I’ll reproduce them here just to show how the code might be applied to another example. Everything from that original tutorial is in quotes. As mentioned, the main packages at work here are the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/acs/acs.pdf">acs</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tigris/tigris.pdf">tigris</a> packages.</p>
<p>Some points about what these packages do:</p>
<p>— The tigris package uses <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html">TIGER/Line Shapefiles etc.</a> which have geographic entity codes which enables them to be linked back to census data.</p>
<p>— The acs package is how you download the census data. Maybe we want specific data sets (like JUST Decennial data, not ACS data). The package literature says about this: “By default, acs.fetch will download 5-year ACS, but as of version 2.0 users must specify a specific”endyear“. Users may also select 1- or 3-year ACS data using the”span=&quot; option, as well as Decennial data using the “dataset” option. (When dataset=“sf1” or “sf3”, span will be reset to 0 regardless of any explict or default options.) At present, the API provides five-, three- and one-year data for a variety of different endyears, and Decennial data for 2010, 2000, and 1990; see the chart below and/or visit <a href="http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html" class="uri">http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html</a> to learn more about what is available through the API. (Warning: support for 1990 is a bit unreliable as of the date of this version, due to non-standard variable lookup tables.)“.</p>

<p>You have to get a census API key <a href="http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html">here</a>.</p>

# &quot;!!!! important note -- the package has not been updated to 2013&quot;
# &quot;data so I&#39;m using the five year span that ends in 2012&quot;

# if you want to change the data you are getting you change the table.number variable. This table.number comes from the ID field in the American Fact Finder tool from the census bureau. This one here has &quot;Household Income in the Past 12 Months&quot;

<p>See? You can play around with the map! Zoom in, click on specific tracts to see demographic information, etc!</p>
<p>If you’d like to save your map, follow these steps:</p>
